## The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript ## 

TypeScript’s static type system is a game-changer for modern web development, offering features like union types and intersection types to create flexible and robust type definitions. Here’s a concise overview:

# Union Types:
Union types allow a variable to hold one of several specified types, making them ideal for scenarios with multiple valid options.

type StringOrNumber = string | number;
let value: StringOrNumber;
value = "Salam"; // Valid
value = 25;      // Valid

Why Use Them?
Flexibility: Handle diverse data types (e.g., API responses).
Type Guards: Narrow types at runtime using typeof or instanceof.


# Intersection Types:
Intersection types combine multiple types into one, requiring a value to satisfy all specified types. They’re useful for creating composite objects or roles.

type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = { company: string };
type EmployedPerson = Person & Employee;

const abdullah: EmployedPerson = {
  name: "Abdullah",
  company: "ABTech",
};

Why Use Them?
Composable Types: Build complex types by combining simpler ones.
Role Enforcements: Ensure objects conform to multiple contracts.

Union vs. Intersection Types
Use union types for options (e.g., multiple input types).
Use intersection types for combinations (e.g., combining traits).

Best Practices
Use Type Guards: Narrow down union types safely.
Keep it Simple: Avoid overly complex type definitions.
Document Types: Explain complex unions and intersections clearly.

Union and intersection types are core to TypeScript’s flexibility, allowing developers to model real-world problems accurately while ensuring type safety. By using these types effectively, we can write code that is both expressive and maintainable.
